left join

SELECT teachers.t_name,students.s_name
FROM teachers LEFT JOIN students
ON
teachers.t_id=students.t_id;


right join

SELECT teachers.t_id,students.s_name,students.s_class
FROM teachers RIGHT JOIN students 
ON
teachers.t_id=students.t_id;

cross join

SELECT teachers.t_name,students.s_id
FROM teachers CROSS JOIN students ;



----------------------

types of joins:
1.inner join or join
2.left join
3.right join
4.cross join
5.self join

inner join is used to get common or matching data from 
tbl1 and tbl2.

************

CREATE TABLE CITY(

CID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    CITYNAME VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (CID)

);

INSERT INTO city(CITYNAME)
VALUES
('KARACHI'),
('LAHORE'),
('ISLAMABAD'),
('MULTAN'),
('FAISALABAD');


CREATE TABLE PERSONAL(
ID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    NAME VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    PERCENTAGE INT NOT NULL,
    AGE INT NOT NULL,
    GENDER VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    CITY INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (city) REFERENCES city (CID)

);

INSERT INTO personal
VALUES
(1,"KANWAL",80,20,"FEMALE",1),
(2,"KIRAN",80,21,"FEMALE",2),
(3,"KULSOOM",80,22,"FEMALE",1),
(4,"KAMRAN",80,20,"MALE",2),
(5,"KAMIL",80,22,"MALE",1),
(6,"KHANSA",80,22,"FEMALE",3);

inner join syntax:
select columns
from tbl1 inner join tbl2 
on tbl1.colname=tbl2.colname;

here : tbl1.colname will be of foreign key col and tbl2.colname will be of primary key col

practical:

for all columns from both tables:

SELECT * FROM personal INNER JOIN city
on personal.CITY=city.CID;

for selective columns from both tables:

SELECT p.ID,p.NAME,p.PERCENTAGE,p.AGE,p.GENDER,c.CITYNAME  FROM personal p INNER JOIN city c
on p.CITY=c.CID;

with where clause:

SELECT p.ID,p.NAME,p.PERCENTAGE,p.AGE,p.GENDER,c.CITYNAME  FROM personal p INNER JOIN city c
on p.CITY=c.CID
WHERE c.CITYNAME="KARACHI";

with order by clause:

SELECT p.ID,p.NAME,p.PERCENTAGE,p.AGE,p.GENDER,c.CITYNAME  FROM personal p INNER JOIN city c
on p.CITY=c.CID
WHERE c.CITYNAME="KARACHI"
ORDER BY p.NAME

;

with only join clause:

SELECT p.ID,p.NAME,p.PERCENTAGE,p.AGE,p.GENDER,c.CITYNAME  FROM personal p  JOIN city c
on p.CITY=c.CID
WHERE c.CITYNAME="KARACHI"
ORDER BY p.NAME

;

-----------------

left join or left outer join:

select a . * ,b.* from teacher as a 
letf join student as b
on a.tid=b.tid;

it will show common data from both table and also all data from teacher table because
we use left join ...jo phla table hoga wo left table and dosra right table hoga.

****************
right join
select a . * ,b.* from teacher as a 
right join student as b
on a.tid=b.tid;

it will show common data from both table and also all data from student table because
we use right join ...jo phla table hoga wo left table and dosra right table hoga.

*******************
full outer join 

it is not supported in my sql but we can implement it too..
it will display common data from both left and right tables and also dispaly all extrra data
their is no keyword for full outer join so thats why we use UNION keyword


select a . * ,b.* from teacher as a 
letf join student as b
on a.tid=b.tid;

UNION

select a . * ,b.* from teacher as a 
right join student as b
on a.tid=b.tid;

*******************

SELF JOIN
a self join statement joins or compare a table with it self.
it means that self join compares records of a column with the other
there is no keyword for self join 

we divide a table into 2 portions and then apply SELF JOIN between them..

table before applying selfjoin

empid		empname		managerid
1		empname		4
2		mangrname	3
3		empname		2
4		magnrname	null

table after applying self join

emp		manger
empname		mangrname
empname		mangrname


syntax:
select a.empname as employee ,b.empname as manager from 
emptbl as a 
inner join 
emptbl as b
on a.mangrid=b.empid;
it will display common data from both parts

select a.empname as employee ,b.empname as manager from 
emptbl as a 
left join 
emptbl as b
on a.mangrid=b.empid;
it will display common data from both parts and also all data from part 2 bcs of left join.
